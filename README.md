## Upscaling and Enhanced User Interface of Monster Hunter Freedom

**Project created to provide an interface high-resolution option more fidelity to the visual and artistic identity of the textures created for the first generation of this franchise.**

This project was created to serve as a complement to the [AFOOT03939](https://github.com/AFOOT03939)'s project
which has most of the improved textures of this game, with the exception of the interface textures that were only enhanced by ESRGAN.

So thanks to comrade [Monkbreh](https://github.com/Monkbreh/MHFU-Texture-Port)'s project, which had textures extracted from the IOs version of (MHFU) I was able to somehow match the interface of this game, textures extracted from (Monster Hunter) and (Monster Hunter G) were also needed to complete the package.

Most textures were adjusted manually and some interface units had to be redone from scratch to deliver something closer to a sharper result.

I hope you like it!!!
